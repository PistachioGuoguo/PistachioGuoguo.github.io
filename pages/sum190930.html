        Life can proceed in the most unexpected way, that is what life in Nanjing University would had possibly convinced me. Back to June 2014 when Gaokao was over, I wanted nothing but physics. Scored 660 with Nanjing University being my third choice, I suppose if it was not destiny I could not be myself today, since one mark higher or lower I would have ended up in a completely different city.

    <p>

        Life was terrible in the beginning, admitted to urban planning a major I dislike, plus the agony of unrequited love, made me less wonder why there are people in this world wants to terminate themselves. Rhythm was idle with mostly boring lectures first year, but mapping, architecture modelling, gradually held people all night. I even thought of going back to high school to re-Gaokao at the end of 2015, quite serious.

        Mom came over Nanjing to help, but after a day's inquiry of my inclined majors, all of the replies are 'too late'. Turning point befall the desparate moment, during dinner at cafeteria I met my Dr.Enhua Xu, who suggested me Financial Engineering in the School of Management and Engineering after knowing the situation. I succeeded in tranferring in 2016 with the sole help of Ms.Xiaozhi Li. They are my life saviors.

    <p>
        I met tons of challenges in my post-transfer study, but eventually happy every day. I had to retake 14 credit so-called higher level mathmatics, I had to synchronize pace with my peers who started two years before me, I had to endure lonliness and commute between different classes and campuses, but I am now more than used to the abscence of reliable teammates and to finish all team project alone, at my level. 
    <p>
        I also met an amazing person who had deeply shaped me, justfied me every reason to pursue perfection in every way. After two years of fruitless chasing I think I am now fully feathered and ready to fly.

    <p>
        Looking back at the five years, even those dull times are colorful through the rainbowy reminiscient spectacles. Nanjing University is not perfect, but it is the very lovely place where I had grown up, and I do miss her.  (Sep 30, 2019)
