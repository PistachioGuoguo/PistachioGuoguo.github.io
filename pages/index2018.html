<h1 class="separator", id="sec: Biography">Biography</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px">I was admitted to <i>School of Architecture and Urban Planning, Nanjing University</i> in September 2014 (first choice <i>Physics</i>), and by chance transferred to <i>Financial Engineering, School of Management and Engineering</i> in <b>September 2016</b>. There I gained my second life by rediscovering point of interest, and luckily burgeoned to be a productive, confident young man. You may see my latest resume <a href="/files/re1026.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (Dec-05-2018 edition). <br><a href="#title">[go top]</a></p>

<h1 class="separator", id="sec: Research Interest"> Interests</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px">
    
    I am now having general interest in <b>computer science</b> and <b>applied math</b>, for they empower us with greater freedom in addressing challenging problems, where I find most enticing, plus they help elicit a deconstructional framework to  understand clearer the way world works. On a more specific level, influenced by summer research my current interest would  be among the interdisciplinary area of <b>modelling, optimizaiton, statistical learning</b>, and hopefully it shall converge as my knowledge and experience expands.<br>

During 2018 summer vacation I stayed in Nanjing beginning my first research experience meanwhile getting my first paper, and after many days and nights modifying and debugging the simulated Photon system finally came out. My communication skills also improved through writing dozens of pages of LaTeX documents discussing with advisors <a href="http://im.nju.edu.cn/teacherinfo.do?mid=4&mmid=7ddbacf0-2a46-11e5-8e21-002454d0cc1b&tid=44cf84b1-fa6b-11e6-8b8d-40a8f01ece83" target="_blank">Prof. Xiaowei Ding</a>, <a   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteryyan/"target="_blank"> Dr. Peter Yan</a>, as well as bravely consulting with experts from outside (e.g <a href="http://www.menet.umn.edu/~zwang/" target="_blank">Prof. Zizhuo Wang</a>). As for the optimization part, although it was not a full success but just intrigued me to study harder in CS and math and only in that way I would be unflappable by most such conundrums.

        The mission of this project was to build a portfolio, with the benefit of being supervised by professional investors. To win out, I borrowed many investment related books and formulated a framework in a short time, tested various quantitative strategies with dozens pages of SAS and Matlab code. I also bought a Wind account for $400 to get research reports and data. This experience gave me a panoramic view as well as brought many new thinkings and understandings of both investment and life.   <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vcPSJJ-avLEmcr9mh-ZE95s6vz3-eZt4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> [Google Drive Link]</a>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px"><b>1. Top Ten Readers of Nanjing University</b>
<br>
    These years I formed habit of reading and became rather good at it. Last year I was elected Top Ten Reader with annual borrowings of 249, and it was not done at one kick. The days in the library equipped me with fast learning and strong indexing ability, where I took broad interest in treasure hunting from science, literature, philosophy, photography, even Photoshop, and every trickle conjoined to my unique thought.

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px"><b>2. My enthusiasm in LaTeX</b>
<br>
    My usage in Microsoft Word drops dramatically the day I got to use LaTeX. I wrote a WeChat-interfaced chat log saver template, also typesetting the GRE reading to make it look exactly the real test, as a matter of fact my verbal score improved from 156 to 163 the second time partly because I was adapted. I believe it is most cool when creativity combined with technology, thinking, life even world seemed more clearer and structured with LaTeX, big fan of Prof.Knuth and Prof.Lamport! On Dec 19 I finished writing <a href="/files/l4len.pdf" target="_blank"> a LaTeX handbook</a> to make future use of LaTeX more convenient for me also my friends. I also tend to apply likewise elegant structure on myself knowledge system in different areas like programming languages, machine learning etc. to help see through the essence and promote understanding thusly.

                    I developed the hobby of long run in Apr 2018, and has lost 20 pounds by far. As a result of nearly everyday training, my 1000m personal best is now anomalously 3:16 (equivalent to score of 100), whereas last year it was 4:26 (4:30 is score of 60). I now take pleasure in running fast and training hard, and believe keeping in good shape will in turn buttress work and study. My next goals are to have a sub-20 5k and a sub-3 1k.
